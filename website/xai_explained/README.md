Welcome to the **XAI Explained** project — a fully responsive, educational website designed to demystify Explainable AI (XAI). This site is built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript (optional) to engage both technical and non-technical audiences.

## 🧠 Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for building trust in AI systems. This project presents a structured, multi-page website with clean navigation and visually appealing layouts.

## 📄 Pages Included

There are 11 HTML pages in this site:

### 🔹 Main Pages (7)

1. **what-is-xai.html** – Introduction to Explainable AI.
2. **xai-key-concept.html** – Key principles and ideas behind XAI.
3. **xai-technique.html** – Overview of common XAI techniques.
4. **application.html** – Real-world applications of XAI.
5. **challenges.html** – Challenges in implementing XAI.
6. **future.html** – Future of explainable artificial intelligence.
7. **resource.html** – External links, datasets, and papers.

### 🔸 Subpages (4)
Each subpage deep-dives into a specific XAI technique.

1. **feature-attribution.html**
2. **example-based.html**
3. **surrogate-models.html**
4. **visualization-techniques.html**

## 🎨 Styling

Each HTML page has its **own dedicated CSS file**, plus a shared `base.css` for consistent layout and branding across the website.
